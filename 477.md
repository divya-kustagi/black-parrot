## Phase 3 Results
Two programs run successfully after RTL modifications. They are hello_world and rv64ui-p-blt. For the rest of the programs the Co-simulation failed

1. IPC Metric

|         | hello_world (Baseline) | rv64ui-p-blt (Baseline)| hello_world (Modified)| rv64ui-p-blt (Modified) | 
|---------|-------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
|  clk    |  235 |  932 |  235 |  932  |
|  instr  |  70  |  268 |  70  |  268  |
|  poison |  122 |  628 |  122 |  628  |
|  roll   |  24  |   0  |  24  |   0   |
|  mIPC   |  297 |  287 |  297 |  287  |

Note: We see no improvement in the IPC metric as expected, since our design predominantly targets Area optimization of the chip owing to varying dcache sizes


## Phase 4 Results
The same two programs hello_world and rv64ui-p-blt run successfully after backend run. For the rest of the programs the Co-simulation failed

1. IPC Metric

|         | hello_world (Baseline) | rv64ui-p-blt (Baseline)| hello_world (Modified)| rv64ui-p-blt (Modified) | 
|---------|-------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
|  clk    |  235 |  932 |  235 |  932  |
|  instr  |  70  |  268 |  70  |  268  |
|  poison |  122 |  628 |  122 |  628  |
|  roll   |  24  |   0  |  24  |   0   |
|  mIPC   |  297 |  287 |  297 |  287  |

Note: Similar to phase 3, we expect no improvement here.


2. Performance Metric

|                    |Baseline, 32KB, 8-way|Modified, 16KB, 4-way|Improvement over baseline|Modified, 8KB, 2-way|Improvement over baseline|
|--------------------|---------|-------------|---------|-------------|--------|
| Area (um^2)        | 958948  | 657673.2039 |  31.42% | 486830.3853 | 49.23% |
| Max Freq (MHz)     |  152.88 |   130.53    | -14.6%  |    137.95   | -9.7%  |
| Joules/instruction |  0.085  |   0.0822    |  -3.3%  |     0.073   | -14.1% |

Note: Joules/instruction numbers are obtained for the program 'rv64ui-p-blt'


## Summary:
Since we ran out of time to fix RTL issues, we pushed our modified design at this stage through the backend flow. We see improvement in area much beyond are estimates with only a small reduction in Max frequency and Energy consumption. Area improved about 31% and 49% for associativity of 4 and 2 respectively. Thus reinforcing the potential of our design.
